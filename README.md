# Event Management

It is intended to develop an information system with a web interface to collaboratively manage events. Any user can log on to the system and create new events. For each event, other users may be invited, who may or may not accept the invitation. It is also possible to share comments (forum style), files and organize polls (e.g. selecting dates, make decisions).
